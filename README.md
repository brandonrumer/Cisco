# Cisco
Useful python scripts when interacting with Cisco devices.

## Prerequisites

These scripts were written in Python3. There is a big variation in the modules used: paramiko, netmiko, CiscoConfParse. Eventually I may go back and standardize. Check each README file for additional details and be sure to check the script to see if it's labeled Development or Production.

### Note

Use these at your own risk. I am not responsible for config losses or damage that may occur with the use of these scripts.
