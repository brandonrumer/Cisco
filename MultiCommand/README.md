# multicommand.py
Used to apply a set of configs to multiple Cisco devices.

## Prerequisites

This script was a 'branch' (quoted bc it's not a real git branch) of SingleCommand.py, and leverages NetMiko vs Paramko. 

### Note

Use these at your own risk. I am not responsible for config losses or damage that may occur with the use of
